###What is Noti?  
Noti will be your little companion living in your mac menu, relaying any notifications you get on your Android phone with [Pushbullet installed on it](https://pushbullet.com).  
**Noti does one thing, and it does it really well: Notifications.**

##Features

###Dismissal sync
If you dismiss a notification from your mac, it will get dismissed from your device as well, and vice versa.

###Reply to messages, straight from a notification.

Whether it be a SMS, WhatsApp message, or Hangouts message, just enter your reply into the notification itself.

###Actions

If a notification has any actions, you can execute those straight from the notification as well (_Pushbullet Pro required_)

##What it can't do as of yet

- Conversation interface (nice to have)
- File upload (nice to have)
